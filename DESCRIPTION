Description: Analyzing Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry
    (ICP-MS) measurement data to evaluate isotope ratios (IRs) is a
    complex process.  The 'IsoCor' package facilitates this process and
    renders it reproducible by providing a function to run a 'Shiny'-App
    locally in any web browser.  In this App the user can upload data
    files of various formats, select ion traces, apply peak detection and
    perform calculation of IRs and delta values.  Results are provided as
    figures and tables and can be exported. The App, therefore,
    facilitates data processing of ICP-MS experiments to quickly obtain
    optimal processing parameters compared to traditional 'Excel'
    worksheet based approaches. A more detailed description can be found
    in the corresponding article <https://doi.org/10.1039/D2JA00208F>. 
    The most recent version of 'IsoCor' can be tested online at <https://bam.de/isocor>.
